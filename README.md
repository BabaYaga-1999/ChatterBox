3. The userId in the chats collection's messages links back to a document in the users collection, indicating which user sent the message.
4. The friends list in the users collection might link to other user documents, establishing a network of connections between users.

This data model allows for efficient querying and retrieval of chat sessions, individual messages, user posts, and user details. It supports the core features of a chat application while providing flexibility for future enhancements.
